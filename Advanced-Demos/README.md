 **2. Desktop Screen Share**
     This demo shows how to share the desktop/window of the current running OS.  Applicable to desktop platforms only (Windows/MacOS). Note SDK calls for Windows are still under improvement.  **Sharing a specific window on Windows is not working**.  Developer should provide a native plugin to pass the window Id to the app.  <br>

 **3. Transcoding**
     The demo shows the configuration to publish live streaming video to known CDNs, including Youtube, Facebook and Twitch.<br> You need to set up your own CDN provider account and set the required information in order to have this to work.  The button on the UI leads you to the corresponding dashboard area for that provider.

## Developer Environment Requirements

  

- Unity3d 2017 or above

-  [Agora Video SDK from Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/video/agora-video-chat-sdk-for-unity-134502)

- Real devices (Windows, Android, iOS, and Mac supported)

  (Note some feature may require SDK version 3.0.1 and higher.)

  

## Quick Start

  

This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application.

  

### Obtain an App ID

Before you can build and run the project, you will need to add your AppID to the configuration. Go to your [developer accountâ€™s project console](https://console.agora.io/projects), create a new AppId or copy the AppId from an existing project. 

Note it is important that for a production ready project, you should always use an AppId with certificate enabled.  However, in this simple quick start demo, we will skip this part.  So you AppId should be created for testing mode.
